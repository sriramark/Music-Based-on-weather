Mood & Music AI API
Version: 1.0.0
Author: Sriram Krishnakumar
Tech Stack: FastAPI, Python, Pytest, OpenWeatherMap API, Google Gemini API, Last.fm API

# 1. Project Description:
    This application serves as an intelligent song recommendation engine. It takes a user's current mood and city as input, analyzes the real-time weather for that location using external APIs, and determines if the weather contextually aligns with the user's mood.

    The core of this project is its AI-driven logic. Instead of a rigid, hard-coded rules, this application delegates the complex task of weather-mood analysis to the Google Gemini API. Song recommendations are fetched dynamically from the Last.fm API based on mood tags.

# 2. Architecture
    The application is built using a modular architecture to ensure separation of concerns.

    main.py: The FastAPI server entry point.

    weather.py: A service module responsible for all communication with the OpenWeatherMap API.

    gemini_client.py: A service module that handles all communication with the Google Gemini API for mood analysis.

    song_recommender.py: A service module to handle all interactions with the Last.fm API for fetching songs.

    .env: A configuration file to securely store all API keys, keeping them separate from the source code.

    test_main.py: A dedicated module for unit testing.

# 3.  Design Philosophy & Future Work
    The AI-First Approach
    A key requirement of this project was to implement the "mood-weather matching" logic. Initial research (see reference folder) showed that the relationship between weather and human mood is quite complex, subjective, and dependent on both recent weather patterns and long-term climate context.

    Given this complexity, a decision was made to delegate the core reasoning to an AI model (Google Gemini) rather than building a rigid, hard-coded rules engine. This approach has several advantages:

    Nuance and Context: The AI can understand subtle ideas like "rain in a typically dry region is a happy event," which is not ideal to hard-code.

    Maintainability: The logic can be updated by refining the AI prompt rather than rewriting complex code.

    Scalability: It demonstrates a modern, scalable approach to solving complex, non-deterministic problems.

    Future Work: A Self-Improving Model

    While using a general-purpose AI like Gemini is powerful, a more cost-effective and specialized solution would be to train a custom machine learning model. The primary obstacle to this approach is the lack of large, publicly available datasets directly linking weather data to user moods.

    This application is designed to help solve that problem. The `main.py` module can include a logging feature that records the user's mood and the AI's prediction for every request. Over time, this will build a valuable, proprietary dataset.

    A future version of this project could use this logged data to train a custom classification model. This "learning model" would become more accurate and tailored to the application's specific use case over time, potentially reducing reliance on the more expensive general-purpose AI for the core logic.

# 4.  Setup and Installation
    Follow these steps to run the application locally.

    **Prerequisites:**
    1. Python 3.8 or higher
    2. OpenWeatherMap API Key
    3. Google Gemini API Key
    4. Last.fm API Key

    **Step 1: Create the Environment File**  
    In your project root, create a file named `.env` and add your API keys in the following format:  
    OWM_API_KEY="your_actual_openweathermap_api_key"  
    GEMINI_API_KEY="your_actual_gemini_api_key"  
    LASTFM_API_KEY="your_actual_lastfm_api_key"

    **Step 2: Install Dependencies**  
    It is recommended to use a virtual environment.  
    - Create a virtual environment:  
        `python -m venv venv`  
    - Activate the environment:  
        On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`  
        On macOS/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`  
    - Install the required packages:  
        `pip install -r requirements.txt`

    **Step 3: Run the FastAPI Server**  
    Start the server using Uvicorn:  
    `uvicorn main:app --reload`  
    The application will be available at http://127.0.0.1:8000, and the interactive API docs can be accessed at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs.

# 5.  Unit Testing
    This project uses pytest for unit testing. The tests are designed to run without making real API calls by "mocking" the external services. This ensures that we are only testing the application's internal logic.

    To run the tests:

    Simply run the following command in your terminal from the project's root directory:

    pytest
